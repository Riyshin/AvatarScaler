# AvatarScaler

To use this tool on your avatar, head over to the top under Riyshin/Avatar Scaler or Shift + S for the hotkey to open the Avatar Scaler window.

Drag your Avatar into the slot and make sure your Avatar has an Avatar Descriptor, otherwise you won't be able to drag it in.

Very easy to use, just slide the slider to a size of your desire. The View Position and Trails are also being adjusted for you too.

You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/Riyshin/AvatarScaler/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">HERE</a>.
